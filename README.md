# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## 1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to delivering business insights through SQL analysis and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The objective of this project is to:

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Execute SQL queries for business insights
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Present findings in a structured analytical report

This project showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, and Business Intelligence tools.

### Dataset Features:
- CSV structured data
- Numerical and categorical columns
- Missing values and inconsistencies
- Suitable for SQL querying and dashboard visualization

### Data Cleaning Performed:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting data types
- Standardizing categorical values
- Creating derived columns for analysis

## 4. Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Loading
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Inspected dataset structure and summary

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Trend identification
- Data visualization

### Step 3: Data Cleaning
- Treated missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Corrected inconsistent formatting
- Converted data types
- Created calculated columns

### Step 4: SQL Analysis
- Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
- Executed queries using:
  - SELECT
  - WHERE
  - GROUP BY
  - ORDER BY
  - JOIN
  - Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
  - Subqueries

### Step 5: Power BI Dashboard
- Connected Power BI to SQL database
- Built data model
- Designed interactive visual dashboard
- Added KPIs, slicers, and filters

### Step 6: Reporting
- Documented key findings
- Provided insights and recommendations

## 5. Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Trend analysis
- Category and segment breakdown
- Top-performing entities
- Interactive filters for dynamic exploration

---

## 6. Results & Insights

- Identified high-performing categories and segments
- Detected trends and patterns
- Highlighted performance gaps
- Provided data-driven recommendations

---

## 7. Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


├── data/ # Raw and cleaned datasets
├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and analysis
├── sql/ # SQL scripts and queries
├── dashboard/ # Power BI (.pbix) file
├── reports/ # Final analytical report
└── README.md # Project documentation

Data visualization and dashboard development

This structure ensures clear separation of data, analysis, SQL scripts, and reporting components.
